This project is part of The Odin Project's 'Foundations' curriculum with a focus on using JavaScript. 

The requirements are as follows:

✅ Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key. 
    - Add a "clear" button.
    - Add a screen to display the output.
    
✅ Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the       next step.   

✅ Make the calculator work!

✅ Extra Credit: Add a '.' button that allows users to input decimals.

✅ Extra Credit: Style it and make it look nice.

✅ Extra Credit: Add a "backspace" button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
